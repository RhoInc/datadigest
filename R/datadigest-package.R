#' Create an interactive codebook
#'
#' The \code{datadigest} package provides a simple interactive framework for exploring data.  
#' The package serves as an R interface for Rho's \code{web-codebook} 
#' JavaScript library. This tool provides a concise summary of every variable in a data frame and 
#' includes interactive features such as real-time filters, grouping, and highlighting. 
#' The R interface allows the analyst to interactively explore datasets within the typical 
#' analysis workflow and working environment.  
#' \code{datadigest} has been built using the [htmlwidgets](htmlwidgets.org) framework.
